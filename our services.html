                    <p><b>Teeth cleaning:</b>This is by far the most common reason people visit the dentist. Many dentists recommend a cleaning every six months, and some recommend once a year. Either way, it’s a very important part of oral health. Your own toothbrush will never be as efficient as the tools a dentist uses to clean your teeth.</p>

                    <p><b>Extractions:</b>Extractions sound scary and painful. Admittedly, they are not the most pleasant of procedures. However, your dentist will do everything in their power to help you feel comfortable. You may need an extraction for any number of reasons.</p>

                    <p><b>Crowns:</b>If your cavity is a little too big for a filling, or the top part of your tooth has decayed, a crown is the solution. These are usually two-visit procedures, but like the filling, shouldn’t be overtly painful. Your dentist will take a molding of your tooth so that a lab can craft a properly fitted crown to cover the decayed area.</p>

                    <p><b>Fillings:</b> Cavities are all too common and all too easy to get. For most cavities, a filling is the recommended answer. Acids in food and inside your body can easily break down tooth enamel if overexposed.</p>
