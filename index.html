            <h3><u>We give you a bright smile</u></h3>
            <p> The aim of our services is to provide a bride grin to all our patients. Treat all the dental issues of our patients so they can live and enjoy freely. Did you know that your oral health offers clues about your overall health — or that problems in your mouth can affect the rest of your body? Protect yourself by learning more about the connection between your oral health and overall health.Like other areas of the body, your mouth teems with bacteria — mostly harmless. But your mouth is the entry point to your digestive and respiratory tracts, and some of these bacteria can cause disease.

                Normally the body's natural defenses and good oral health care, such as daily brushing and flossing, keep bacteria under control. However, without proper oral hygiene, bacteria can reach levels that might lead to oral infections, such as tooth decay and gum disease.
        
                Also, certain medications — such as decongestants, antihistamines, painkillers, diuretics and antidepressants — can reduce saliva flow. Saliva washes away food and neutralizes acids produced by bacteria in the mouth, helping to protect you from microbes that multiply and lead to disease.
        
                Studies suggest that oral bacteria and the inflammation associated with a severe form of gum disease (periodontitis) might play a role in some diseases. And certain diseases, such as diabetes and HIV/AIDS, can lower the body's resistance to infection, making oral health problems more severe. </p>

            <p><b>Gum diseases:</b> Gingivitis is the early stage and mild form of gum or periodontal disease. It is a bacterial infection that is caused by the buildup of plaque. Common symptoms are gums that are red, swollen, and bleed easily. You may also experience bad breath and sensitive teeth that hurt when you chew.</p>
            <p><b>Bad Breath:</b>Bad breath or halitosis is one of the most common dental problems. It is also among the most distressing. One or more of the foods you eat could also be the cause of your halitosis. Spices such as garlic and onion are common culprits.</p>
            <p><b>Sensitive teeth:</b>Your teeth become sensitive to hot and cold foods and drinks when the enamel is worn away and the dentin is exposed. 

                The dentin has tubes that lead to the nerve deeper inside the tooth. Hot or cold substances can travel along the tubes to the nerve and cause intense pain.</p>
            <p><b>Cracked or Broken Teeth:</b>A cracked or broken tooth can cause you a lot of pain, depending on the extent of the damage. Regardless of how bad you think the crack or chip is, you should have it examined and treated by a dentist as soon as possible.</p>
